1- We implemented exploration/aggregation/descriptive operations on big dataSet
2- Do Visualizations,using matplotlib lib ( bar chart, pie cahrt, Scatter chart)

3- WE Use in our assignment These Libraries: 
	A- import numpy as np    // To do Array processing
	B- import pandas as pd   // To Do Data analysis, wrangling and common exploratory operations
	C- from pandas import Series, DataFrame
	D- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt   // To do For visualization. Matplotlib for basic viz and seaborn for more stylish figures
	E- import seaborn as sns	     // To do For visualization. Matplotlib for basic viz and seaborn for more stylish figures. 
	Seaborn is statistical data visualization libarary bulit on top of Matplotlib. Use to generate Plots graphs. We gonna need (numpy, pandas, matplotlib) otherwise Seaborn will not work

4-  We use Weka as another tool to Visualize our assignment and get graphs

5- We use Scikit-learn(sklearn)library to do Classifier data and predicate future values then test accuracy of data before the predication and after. then visualize results using Scatter plot.
